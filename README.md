# Cs241-FinalProject

   The problem we aimed to solve with our project is a common one for Alaskans, iced windshields. This issue is an inconvenience to most as you must wait for your windshield to thaw, but reduced visibility can also prove fatal on the road. It can take 5-15 minutes for a windshield to completely deice so we aimed to significantly reduce this time by providing an additional heating element to the glass. The goal was to create a wireless control to start a heater for your windshield, as if it were an autostart, as this would drastically reduce waiting time, while also making the roads a safer place.

   To solve the problem of iced windshields we decided to create a remotely controlled heating fan to be used on the glass. Our first step was to find a part that could receive a signal, so we decided to use a nodemcu ESP8266. We then spent a large portion of our time getting the nodemcu to receive a signal sent from a website created with the ESP8266 library. After this was accomplished we used html to format a website that could be used to control the nodemcu. Once this was complete we realized that there was unfortunately not enough time to install a heating element, as all the options we looked into seemed difficult/dangerous to power in our timeline and with our level of expertise.
